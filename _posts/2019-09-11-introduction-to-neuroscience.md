This is going to be a series of WIP posts on neuroscience, in which I will try to summarize a neuroscience textbook I am reading at this moment called ["Neuroscience: Exploring the brain"](https://www.amazon.fr/Neuroscience-Exploring-Mark-F-Bear/dp/0781760038) by [Mark F. Bear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Bear), [Barry W. Connors](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/bconnors) and [Michael A. Paradiso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Paradiso).

## A bit of history

- Hippocrates (460–379 B.C.E.), the father of Western medicine, believed that the brain was not only involved in sensation but was also the seat of intelligence.

- The famous Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) clung to the belief that the heart was the center of intellect. What function did Aristotle reserve for the brain? He believed it was a radiator for cooling blood that was overheated by the seething heart. The rational temperament of humans was thus explained by the large cooling capacity of our brain.

- The most important figure in Roman medicine was the Greek physician and writer Galen (130–200 C.E.), who embraced the Hippocratic view of brain function.

- The nervous system consists of two divisions, the central nervous system (**CNS**) and the peripheral nervous system (**PNS**). The **CNS** consists of the brain and spinal cord. The three major parts of the *brain* are the <u>cerebrum</u>, <u>the cerebellum</u>, and the <u>brain stem</u>. The **PNS** consists of the <u>nerves</u> and nerve cells that lie <u>outside the brain and spinal cord</u>.

- The cerebrum lobes:

	<p align='center'>
		<img align="center" src='/assets/images/neuroscience/cerebrum_lobes.png'/>
	</p>

	- The **deep Sylvian fissure**, dividing <u>the frontal lobe</u> from <u>the temporal lobe</u>.
	- The **central sulcus**, dividing <u>the frontal lobe</u> from <u>the parietal lobe</u>. 
	- The <u>occipital lobe</u> lies at the back of the brain. 
	- These landmarks can be found on all human brains.

- This is how the nervous system was understood at the end of the eighteenth century:
	- Injury to the brain can disrupt sensations, movement, and thought and can cause death.
	- The brain communicates with the body via the nerves.
	- The brain has different identifiable parts, which probably perform different functions.
	- The brain operates like a machine and follows the laws of nature.

- Within each nerve of the body there are many thin filaments, or *nerve fibers*, each one of which could serve as an individual
wire carrying information in a different direction.

- Around 1810, Scottish physician Charles Bell and French physiologist François Magendie concluded that within each nerve is a mixture of many wires, some of which bring information into the brain and spinal cord and others that send information out to the muscles.

- In figure below, incoming sensory fibers (red ) and outgoing motor fibers (blue) divide into spinal roots where the nerves attach to the spinal cord. Bell and Magendie found that the **ventral roots** contain only <u>motor fibers</u> and the **dorsal roots** contain only <u>sensory fibers</u>.
	<p align='center'>![alt text](/assets/images/neuroscience/ventral_dorsal_roots.png)</p>
	
- The approach, in which parts of the brain are systematically destroyed to determine their function, is called **the experimental ablation method.**

- In 1823, the esteemed French physiologist Marie-Jean-Pierre Flourens used this method in a variety of animals (particularly birds) to show that the cerebellum does indeed play a role in the coordination of movement. He also concluded that the cerebrum is involved in sensation and perception.

- This new “science” of correlating the structure of the head with personality traits was called **phrenology**.

- The French neurologist Paul Broca (1824–1880) was presented with a patient who could understand language but could not speak. After the man’s death in 1861, Broca carefully examined his brain and found a lesion in the left frontal lobe. Based on this case and several others like it, Broca concluded that this region of the human cerebrum, **Broca's area**, was specifically responsible for the production of speech. The lesion that produced this deficit is circled in figure below.

	<p align='center'>
		<img align="center" src='/assets/images/neuroscience/broca_s area.png'/>
	</p>

- In 1839, German zoologist Theodor Schwann proposed what came to be known as **the cell theory**: All tissues are composed of microscopic units called cells.

- The brain has been called the most complex
piece of matter in the universe.

- Most neuroscientists today use *animal models* to examine processes they wish to understand in humans.

- History has clearly shown that understanding how the brain works is a big challenge. To reduce the complexity of the problem, neuroscientists break it into smaller pieces for systematic experimental analysis. This
is called the *reductionist approach*. The size of the unit of study defines what is often called **the level of analysis**. In ascending order of complexity, these levels are:
	- **Molecular Neuroscience**: The study of the brain at the most elementary (molecular) level.
	- **Cellular Neuroscience**: The study of the neurons as individual cells. What are their types? What are their functions? How do they perform computation?
	- **Systems Neuroscience**: The study of constellations of neurons that form complex circuits performing a common function, such as the "visual system" and the "motor system".
	- <u>**Behavioral Neuroscience**</u>: How do neural systems work together to produce integrated behaviors?
	- <u>**Cognitive Neuroscience**</u>: How the activity of the brain creates the mind?
	
- Broadly speaking, neuroscience research (and neuroscientists) may be divided into three types: *clinical*, *experimental*, and *theoretical*.
	+ Many who conduct *clinical* research continue in the tradition of Broca, attempting to deduce from the behavioral effects of brain damage the functions of various parts of the brain.
	+ The *experimental* approaches run experiments on the brain to try to understand it. These approaches include *neuroanatomists*, who use sophisticated microscopes to trace connections in the brain; *neurophysiologists*, who use electrodes to measure the brain’s electrical activity; *neuropharmacologists*, who use drugs to study the chemistry of brain function ...
	+ <u>*Theoretical* neuroscience</u> uses mathematical and computational tools to understand the brain at all levels of analysis and tries to establish the mathematical principles of nervous system organization.

- The scientific process consists of four essential steps: *observation*, *replication*, *interpretation*, and *verification*.

- A lot is known about the function of the brain. But what we know is insignificant compared with what is still left to be learned.


# Brain cells: Neurons and Glia

- All tissues and organs in the body consist of cells. The specialized functions of cells and how they interact determine the functions of organs.

- There are two different types of cells in the nervous system: **neurons** and **glia**. These are broad categories, within which are many types of cells that differ in structure, chemistry, and function.

- There are approximately equal numbers of *neurons* and *glia* in the adult human brain (roughly **85 billion** of each type).

- **Neurons** sense changes in the environment, communicate these changes to other neurons, and command the body’s responses to these sensations.

- **Glia**, or **glial cells**, contribute to brain function mainly by insulating, supporting, and nourishing neighboring neurons.

- The term **glia** is derived from the Greek word for “glue,” giving the impression that the main function of these cells is to keep the brain from running out of our ears!

- Several obstacles to study the structure of the brain.

- Most cells are in the range of 0.01–0.05 mm in diameter.

- To observe brain tissue using a microscope, it was necessary to make very thin slices, ideally not much thicker than the diameter of the cells. However, brain tissue has a consistency like a bowl of Jell-O: not firm enough to make thin slices.

- Scientists discovered how to harden, or “fix,” tissues by immersing them in **formaldehyde**, and they developed a special device called a ***microtome*** to make very thin slices.

- The final breakthrough in neurohistology was the introduction of **stains** that selectively color some, but not all, parts of the cells in brain tissue.

- The German neurologist Franz Nissl, in the late nineteenth century, showed that a class of **basic aniline dyes** would stain the nuclei of all cells as well as clumps of material
surrounding the nuclei of neurons:

	<p align='center'>
		<img align="center" src='/assets/images/neuroscience/nissl_stain.png'/>
	</p>

- The **Nissl stain** is extremely useful for two reasons: It distinguishes between neurons and glia, and it enables histologists to study the arrangement, or cytoarchitecture , of neurons in different parts of the brain.

- In 1873, Italian histologist Camillo Golgi (1843–1926) proposed a more advanced stain. He discovered that soaking brain tissue in a silver chromate solution, now called the **Golgi stain**, makes a small percentage of neurons become darkly colored in their entirety.

	<p align='center'>
		<img align="center" src='/assets/images/neuroscience/golgi_stain.png'/>
	</p>

- The basic parts of the neuron are: a central region that contains the cell nucleus and numerous thin tubes that radiate away from the central region.

	<p align='center'>
		<img align="center" src='/assets/images/neuroscience/neuron.png'/>
	</p>

- The swollen region containing the cell nucleus has several names that are used interchangeably: **cell body**, **soma** (plural:somata), and **perikaryon** (plural: perikarya).

- The thin tubes that radiate from the soma are called **neurites** and are of two types: **axons** and **dendrites**.

- Because **axons** can extend over great distances in the body (a **meter** or more), histologists of the day immediately recognized that axons must act like **“wires”** that carry the output of the neurons. 

- **Dendrites**, on the other hand, are rarely longer than **2 mm**. And because dendrites come in contact with many axons, they must act as the antennae of the neuron to receive incoming signals, or input.

- A Spanish contemporary Santiago Ramón y Cajal (1852–1934). used the Golgi stain to work out the circuitry of many regions of the brain:

	<p align='center'>
		<img align="center" src='/assets/images/neuroscience/cajal_drawing.png'/>
	</p>

- The letters label the different elements Cajal identified in an area of the human cerebral cortex that controls voluntary movement.

- Golgi championed the view that the neurites of different cells
are fused together to form a continuous reticulum, or network, similar to the arteries and veins of the circulatory system.

- Cajal, on the other hand, argued forcefully that the neurites of different neurons are not continuous with each other and communicate by *contact*, not *continuity*.

- This idea that cell theory - which states that the individual cell is the elementary functional unit of all animal tissues, also applies to neurons came to be known as the **neuron doctrine**.

- The scientific evidence over the next 50 years strongly supported the neuron doctrine.

- Neurites below were reconstructed from a series of images made using an electron microscope. The axon (colored yellow) is in contact with a dendrite (colored blue).

	<p align='center'>

	</p>


## Inside a neuron

- The neuron (also called a nerve cell ) consists of several
parts: *the soma*, *the dendrites*, and *the axon*.

	<p align='center'>
		<img align="center" src='/assets/images/neuroscience/neuron_structure.png'/>
	</p>

- The inside of the neuron is separated from the outside by *the neuronal membrane*.

- The cell body of the typical neuron is about 20 µm in diameter.

- The watery fluid inside the cell, called the **cytosol** , is a *salty*, *potassium-rich* solution that is separated from the outside by *the neuronal membrane*. 

- Within the soma are a number of membrane-enclosed structures
called **organelles**.

- The cell body of the neuron contains the same organelles found in all animal cells.

- The most important ones are the *nucleus*, *the rough endoplasmic reticulum*, *the smooth endoplasmic reticulum*, *the Golgi apparatus*, and *the mitochondria*. More details on each one of these components are to be found in Page 29 of the book.

- Mitochondria are the site of *cellular respiration*. They produce the cell’s energy source called **adenosine triphosphate (ATP)**.

- The chemical energy stored in ATP fuels most of the biochemical reactions of the neuron.

- Everything contained within the confines of the cell membrane, including the *organelles* but excluding the *nucleus*&mdash; within which are chromosomes containing the genetic material DNA&mdash; is referred to collectively as the **cytoplasm**.

- *Protein synthesis* occurs at dense globular structures in the cytoplasm called **ribosomes** &mdash; protein factories of the cell. 

- The **neuronal membrane** serves as a barrier to enclose the cytoplasm inside the neuron and to exclude certain substances that float in the fluid that bathes the neuron.

- The neuronal membrane is about 5 nm thick and is studded with proteins.

- Some of the membrane-associated proteins pump substances from the inside to the outside. Others form pores that regulate which substances can gain access to the inside of the neuron.

- The **cytoskeleton**, which is a complex, *dynamic* network of interlinking protein filaments,  is what gives the cell its shape and mechanical resistance to deformation. It is essentially composed of *microtubules*, *microfilaments*, and *neurofilaments*. More details on these components are to be found in page 39 of the book.

	<p align='center'>
		<img align="center" src='/assets/images/neuroscience/cytoskeleton.png'/>
	</p>

- Structures explored so far, that are *the soma*, *organelles*, *membrane*, and *cytoskeleton* are not unique to neurons but are found in all the cells in our body.

- **The axon** is a structure found only in neurons and highly specialized for the transfer of information over distances in the nervous system.

	<p align='center'>
		<img align="center" src='/assets/images/neuroscience/axon_collaterals.png'/>
	</p>

- The axon begins with a region called the **axon hillock** , which tapers away from the soma to form the initial segment of the **axon proper**.

- There are no *ribosomes* to be found in the axon. Meaning that all proteins in the axon must originate in the soma. 

- The different proteins in the axonal membrane enable it to serve as a wire that sends information over great distances.

- Axons may extend from less than a millimeter to over a meter long.

- Axons often branch, and these branches, called **axon collaterals** can travel long distances to communicate with different parts of the nervous system.

- Occasionally, an axon collateral returns to communicate with the same cell that gave rise to the axon or with the dendrites of neighboring cells. These axon branches are called **recurrent collaterals**.

- The diameter of an axon is variable, ranging from less than 1 µm to about 25 µm in humans and to as large as 1 mm in squid.

- The speed of the electrical signal that sweeps down the axon—*the nerve impulse*— depends on the axonal diameter. The thicker the axon, the faster the impulse travels.

- All axons have a beginning (*the axon hillock*), a middle (*the axon proper*), and an end. The end is called the **axon terminal** or **terminal bouton**.

- The terminal is a site where the axon comes in contact with other neurons (or other cells) and passes information on to them.

- This point of contact is called the **synapse**.

	<p align='center'>
		<img align="center" src='/assets/images/neuroscience/synapse.png'/>
	</p>

- The synapse has two sides: *presynaptic* and *postsynaptic*. These names indicate the usual direction of information flow from “pre” to “post”.

- The presynaptic side generally consists of an axon terminal, whereas the postsynaptic side may be a dendrite or the soma of another neuron.

- The space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes is called the **synaptic cleft**. 

- The transfer of information at the synapse from one neuron to another is called **synaptic transmission**.

- At most synapses, information in the form of electrical impulses traveling down the axon is converted in the terminal into a chemical signal that crosses the synaptic cleft.

- On the postsynaptic membrane, this chemical signal is converted again into an electrical one.

- The chemical signal, called a **neurotransmitter** , is stored in and released from the synaptic vesicles within the terminal.

- This *electrical-to-chemical-to-electrical* transformation of information makes possible many of the brain’s computational abilities. Modification of this process is involved in memory and learning.

- Synaptic transmission dysfunction accounts for certain mental disorders. 

- The synapse is also the site of action for many toxins and for most psychoactive drugs.

- Sometimes axons have many short branches at their ends, and each branch forms a synapse on dendrites or cell bodies in the same region. These branches are collectively called the **terminal arbor**.

- Sometimes axons form synapses at swollen regions along their length and then continue on to terminate elsewhere. Such swellings are called **boutons en passant**.

	<p align='center'>
		<img align="center" src='/assets/images/neuroscience/boutons_en_passant.png'/>
	</p>

- When a neuron makes synaptic contact with another cell, it is said to innervate that cell, or to provide **innervation**.

- The absence of ribosomes in the axon— which are the protein factories of the cell— means that the proteins of the axon must be synthesized in the soma and then shipped down the axon.

- Indeed, in the mid-nineteenth century, English physiologist *Augustus Waller* showed that axons cannot be sustained when separated from their parent cell body.

- The degeneration of axons that occurs when they are cut is now called *Wallerian degeneration*.

- Wallerian degeneration occurs because the normal flow of materials from *the soma* to *the axon terminal* is interrupted. This movement of material down the axon is called **axoplasmic transport**.

	<p align='center'>
		<img align="center" src='/assets/images/neuroscience/axoplasmic_transport.png'/>
	</p>

- Material is enclosed within **vesicles**, which then “walk down” the *microtubules* of the axon. 

- The “legs” are provided by a protein called *kinesin*, and the process is fueled by ATP.

- *Kinesin* moves material only from the soma to the terminal. All movement of material in this direction is called **anterograde transport**.

- There is a mechanism for the movement of material up the axon from the terminal to the soma. Movement in this direction, from
terminal to soma, is called **retrograde transport**.

- The “legs” for retrograde transport are provided by a different protein, *dynein*.

- The dendrites of a single neuron are collectively called a **dendritic tree**; each branch of the tree is called a **dendritic branch**.

- Because dendrites function as the antennae of the neuron, they are covered with thousands of synapses.
(**Neurons** have been made to fluoresce **green**. **Axon terminals** have been made to fluoresce **orange-red**. The **nuclei** are stained to fluoresce **blue**.)
 
 	<p align='center'>
		<img align="center" src='/assets/images/neuroscience/dendrites.png'/>
	</p>

- The dendritic membrane under the synapse (the postsynaptic membrane) has many specialized protein molecules called **receptors** that detect the neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft.

- The dendrites of some neurons are covered with specialized structures called **dendritic spines** that receive some types of synaptic input.

 	<p align='center'>
		<img align="center" src='/assets/images/neuroscience/spines.png'/>
	</p>

- Spines look like little punching bags that hang off the dendrite.

- Spine structure is sensitive to the type and amount of synaptic activity. Unusual changes in spines have been shown to occur in the brains of individuals with cognitive impairments.

## Classifying neurons

- Studying each neuron and how it functions is a complex problem because we have over 85 billion of them.

- Instead, the complexity of the problem might be reduced by categorizing the neurons and understanding the unique contribution of each category rather than each cell.

### Classification Based on Neuronal Structure

- <u>Number of Neurites:</u> Classification according to the total number of neurites (axons and dendrites) that extend from the soma.

	- Most neurons in the brain are multipolar.

	<p align='center'>
		<img align="center" src='/assets/images/neuroscience/classification_neurites.png'/>
	</p>
	
- <u>Dendrites:</u> Classification according to the shape of the dendritic tree and/or to whether their dendrites have spines.

	- **Stellate cells** are star shaped.
	
	- **Pyramidal cells** are pyramid shaped.
	
	- Neurons that have dendritic spines are called **spiny**, and those that do not are called **aspinous**.

	- In the cerebral cortex, all *pyramidal cells* are *spiny*. *Stellate cells*, on the other hand, can be either *spiny* or *aspinous*.
	
	<p align='center'>
		<img align="center" src='/assets/images/neuroscience/stellate_cell.png'/>
		<img align="center" src='/assets/images/neuroscience/pyramidal_cell.png'/>
	</p>

- <u>Connections:</u> 

	- Nerve cells that have neurites in the sensory surfaces of the body, such as the skin and the retina of the eye, are called **primary sensory neurons**.
	
	+ Neurons having axons that form synapses with the muscles and command movements are called **motor neurons**.
	
	+ Most neurons in the nervous system form connections only with other neurons. These cells are called **interneurons**.
	
- <u>Axon Length:</u>

	- Neurons that have long axons that extend from one part of the brain to the other are called **Golgi type I neurons**, or **projection neurons**.
	
	+ Other neurons have short axons that do not extend beyond the vicinity of the cell body; these are called **Golgi type II neurons**, or **local circuit neurons**.
	
	- For e.g. in the cerebral cortex, *pyramidal cells* usually have long axons that extend to other parts of the brain and are therefore *Golgi type I neuron*s. In contrast, *stellate cells* have axons that never extend beyond the cerebral cortex and are therefore *Golgi type II neurons*.
	
### Classification Based on Gene Expression

- Most differences between neurons ultimately can be explained at the genetic level.

- For e.g. differences in gene expression cause pyramidal cells and stellate cells to develop different shapes.

- Once a genetic difference is known, genetic engineering methods are used for measuring and manipulating the functions of neurons in different categories.

- Another important way neurons differ is *the neurotransmitter they use*.

- Neurotransmitter differences arise because of differences in the expression of proteins involved in transmitter synthesis, storage, and use.

- For e.g. *the motor neurons* that command voluntary movements all release the neurotransmitter **acetylcholine** at their synapses; these motor cells are therefore also classified as **cholinergic**, meaning that they express the genes that enable use of this particular neurotransmitter.

## Inside glia

### Astrocytes

- The most numerous glia in the brain are called **astrocytes**.

	<p align='center'>
		<img align="center" src='/assets/images/neuroscience/astrocyte.png'/>
	</p>

- These cells fill most of the spaces between neurons.

- The space that remains between neurons and astrocytes in the brain is only about 20 nm wide. Consequently, astrocytes probably influence whether a neurite can grow or retract.

- An essential role of astrocytes is regulating the chemical content of this *extracellular space*.

- For e.g. astrocytes envelop synaptic junctions in the brain, thereby restricting the spread of neurotransmitter molecules that have been released.

	<p align='center'>
		<img align="center" src='/assets/images/neuroscience/astrocyte_synapse.png'/>
	</p>

- Astrocytes also have special proteins in their membranes that actively remove many neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft.

- Besides regulating neurotransmitters, astrocytes also tightly control the *extracellular concentration* of several substances that could interfere with proper neuronal function. For e.g. astrocytes regulate the concentration of potassium ions in the extracellular fluid.

### Myelinating Glia

- Another glial cells that can be found are **oligodendroglial** and **Schwann** cells.

- Their primary function is clear; they provide layers of membrane that *insulate* axons.

- Boston University anatomist Alan Peters, a pioneer in the electron microscopic study of the nervous system, showed that this wrapping, called **myelin**, spirals around axons in the brain.

- This is how *myelinated optic nerve fibers* look like when cut in cross section.

	<p align='center'>
		<img align="center" src='/assets/images/neuroscience/myelin.png'/>
	</p>

- Because the axon fits inside the spiral wrapping like a sword in its scabbard, the name **myelin sheath** describes the entire covering.

	<p align='center'>
		<img align="center" src='/assets/images/neuroscience/oligodendroglial_cell.png'/>
	</p>

- The sheath is interrupted periodically, leaving a short length where the axonal membrane is exposed. This region is called **a node of Ranvier**.

- *Myelin* serves to speed the propagation of nerve impulses down the axon.

- Oligodendroglia and Schwann cells differ in their location and some other characteristics.

- *Oligodendroglia* are found only in <u>the central nervous system</u> (brain and spinal cord), whereas *Schwann cells* are found only in <u>the peripheral nervous system</u> (parts outside the skull and vertebral column). 

- One *oligodendroglial cell* contributes myelin to <u>several axons</u>, whereas each *Schwann cell* myelinates only <u>a single axon</u>.

### Other Non-Neuronal Cells

- Special cells called **ependymal cells** line fluid-filled ventricles within the brain and play a role in directing cell migration during brain development.

- A class of cells called **microglia** function as **phagocytes** &mdash; cells that ingest or engulf dead or dying cells &mdash; to remove debris left by dead or degenerating neurons and glia.

- In addition to *glial* and *ependymal* cells, the brain also has **vasculature**: arteries, veins, and capillaries that deliver via the blood essential nutrients and oxygen to neurons.

## Conclusion
- Learning the structural characteristics of the neuron provides insight into how neurons and their different parts work because structure correlates with function.

- The absence of *ribosomes* in the axon correctly predicts that proteins in the *axon terminal* are provided from the *soma* via *axoplasmic transport*.

- A large number of mitochondria in the axon terminal correctly predicts a high energy demand. 

- The elaborate structure of the dendritic tree appears ideally suited for receiving incoming information, and indeed, this is where most of the synapses are formed with the axons of other neurons.
